- create a sphere module that puts a really simple sphere on the screen
needs vertex data generated and shuffled in, then a module and bindgroup , camera matrix uniforms... 

- create shader for n body integration, use workgroup id / thread id method technique probably
will have to expand sphere storage buffer to contain the mass , velocity too, probably something like 

- r, px, py, pz, m, vx, vy, vz,(8 * 4 * N) bytes at the end of the buffer, which can then be modified and written into with the 
shader  

- add a random dots param in the uniforms buffer than tells the fragment shader how much uncorrelated noise to add to screen, 

- modularise all code into software ish packaging, getting frustrating moving around the main file now...
