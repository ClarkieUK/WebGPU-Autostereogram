// General Notes

- The adapter simply represents the a specific hardware GPU in our program
- The device represents how the GPU will interface with webGPU via commands, they are buffered and
    executed via the device.

- Drawing position in wgsl are in the clip space which ranges from x{-1,1} y{-1,1}.

// In shaders

- Things that have assigned locations are interstage variables and are passed between the vertex and fragment shader
    but typically in a vertex and fragment shader you may see things like @builtin(position), these builtins can be common
    to the vertex and fragment shader but represent different things, they just happen to share the same name.

- In the vertex shader @builtin(position) represents the coordinate you provide used to draw primatives

- In the fragment shader its an input and represents the pixel coord that the fragment shader is currently being asked to assign
    a color to.

// The General Workflow

- Commands are not executed on the device via the encoder until they are submitted.

- Create a shader module with wgsl, then define a pipeline that uses the different shader components and defines a target

- the pipeline is then used to define bindgroups 

- If using a vertex buffer youll have to add a buffers: descriptor inside the pipeline definition so the GPU knows how to unpack the 
    vertex data

- Textures draw bottom to top, so data shuffled initially will be at the bottom of the canvas / drawing surface

- Compute ID starts (0,0) top left, (W-1,H-1) bottom right

- Canvas 2D typically has positive y moving downwards, for a (-1,1) top left clip space origin.

// nearly done stuff to note 

if you wanna use the vr functionality then youll have to setup the bridge in another terminal (node src/bridge.js)
take the in and out ports inside the slime vr api/app and make sure the devices are on the same wifi network. Annoyingly this means configuring 
the IMU firmware everytime you want to swap. It would also need certain wifi configurations (2.4ghz) and it cant be a crowded network, so maybe 
do hardwiring for demo?
