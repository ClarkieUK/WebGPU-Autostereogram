// General Notes

- The adapter simply represents the a specific hardware GPU in our program
- The device represents how the GPU will interface with webGPU via commands, they are buffered and
    executed via the device.

- Drawing position in wgsl are in the clip space which ranges from x{-1,1} y{-1,1}.

// In shaders

- Things that have assigned locations are interstage variables and are passed between the vertex and fragment shader
    but typically in a vertex and fragment shader you may see things like @builtin(position), these builtins can be common
    to the vertex and fragment shader but represent different things, they just happen to share the same name.

- In the vertex shader @builtin(position) represents the coordinate you provide used to draw primatives

- In the fragment shader its an input and represents the pixel coord that the fragment shader is currently being asked to assign
    a color to.

// The General Workflow

- Commands are not executed on the device via the encoder until they are submitted.

- Create a shader module with wgsl, then define a pipeline that uses the different shader components and defines a target

- the pipeline is then used to define bindgroups 

- If using a vertex buffer youll have to add a buffers: descriptor inside the pipeline definition so the GPU knows how to unpack the 
    vertex data

- Textures draw bottom to top, so data shuffled initially will be at the bottom of the canvas / drawing surface
